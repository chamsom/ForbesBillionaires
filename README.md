# ForbesBillionaires
Utilizing BS4 to automate &amp; scrape the philanthropic data of US billionaires. Data will then be opened as a .csv file in Excel for the purpose of research by prospect management/endowment groups. 

# Abstract
Forbes provides a really unfriendly nesting structure for any of its elements. At work, I was given a project to research candidates for possible philanthropic donations made by billionaires. Instead of manually typing the data one-by-one and driving myself nuts with Excel, I utilized BS4 to scrape the required data and format it within a .csv file.

# Dependencies
Requires Python 3.7 or higher & BeautifulSoup4.
